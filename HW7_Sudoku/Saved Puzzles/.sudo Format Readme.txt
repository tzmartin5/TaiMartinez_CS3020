The first line in a sudo file is the base number for the sudoku puzzle (n).  
So n=3 in a 9x9, n=4 in a 16x16, etc.
	
The next n*n lines contain n*n values separated by pipes ('|'). 
There are only pipes between values not at the start of the line or the end.
	
The pipe-separated values are the givens (starting values) in the sudoku puzzle. 
Squares that start blank can either be nothing or be any number of space or tab columns. 
	Any line starting with a # is a comment and is ignored. The file is processed as though those lines aren't there.

Example file for a 4x4.

	# This is a comment at the start of the file. It doesn't count as the first line.
